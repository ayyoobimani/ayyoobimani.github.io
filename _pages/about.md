I am a third year PhD student supervised by professor [Hinrich Schuetze](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/schuetze/) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/). My research is on Natural Language processing.

I have done research on applications of multilingual large language models for low-resource languages, representation learning, and cross-lingual transfer. I have examined the potential of high-resource language representations to enhance the performance of down-stream tasks in low-resource languages, as well as how can the synergy of having (a little amount of) data in many languages benefit better understanding of each language.  I am also currently investigating methods for improving the efficiency and interpretability of multilingual models.

Before starting a PhD at LMU, I was a member of [Intelligent Information System Lab Laboratory](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA1) at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), as a master student working under supervision of Dr. [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery). During my time there, my research centered on semantic matching for information retrieval systems.
