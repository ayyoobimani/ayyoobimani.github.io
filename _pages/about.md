I am currently an Applied Scientist at Microsoft Germany, where my work focuses on optimizing the efficiency of machine learning models, particularly large language models, and exploring active learning techniques.

Previously, I was a PhD student at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/) supervised by professor [Hinrich Schuetze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIL9dWUAAAAJ&hl=en). During my PhD, my research initially centered on multilingual large language models, specifically exploring their applications for low-resource languages, representation learning, and cross-lingual transfer. I investigated how high-resource language representations can enhance downstream tasks in low-resource languages and how the availability of multilingual data can improve the understanding of each language. As my PhD progressed, I shifted my focus towards improving the parameter efficiency and interpretability of these models.

Before starting a PhD at LMU, I was a member of [Intelligent Information System Lab Laboratory](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA1) at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), as a master student working under supervision of professor [Azadeh Shakery](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery). During my time there, my research centered on semantic matching for information retrieval systems.
